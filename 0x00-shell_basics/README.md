This is a bash script that prints the absolute path of the current working directory.

#!/bin/bash is the shebang line that specifies the script should be executed by the bash shell.

current_directory=$(pwd) sets the variable current_directory to the result of the pwd (present working directory) command, which returns the absolute path of the current working directory.

echo "The absolute path name of the current working directory is: $current_directory" prints a message to the console with the value of current_directory appended to the end of the string. The $ symbol is used to expand the value of the variable
